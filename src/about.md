    content: |
      <p>John Walton’s introduction to the world of architecture and construction began at a young age. Growing up in a family with deep roots in the construction industry, John spent his school holidays on building sites, observing and learning the trades. His father, who managed a construction company, provided John with early exposure to the collaborative process between architects, surveyors, and builders. This experience fostered an appreciation for practical yet thoughtful design, blending creativity with a hands-on approach to construction.</p>
